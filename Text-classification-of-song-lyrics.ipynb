    "\n",
    "Methods: I will use the method we discussed in exercise 1.2. In this exercise we subset the words that where in one part of the dataset, but not in the other. We looked into the words that they had in common and the words that set them apart from eachother. To find out whether a song is a typical popsong or not, we need to know what sets them appart from the rest of the lyrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operalization: \n",
    "1. load the data. \n",
    "2. preprocess the text using tokenization + lemmatization + word positions (VERB + ADJ + NOUN --> substract the most meaningfull words) and flattening over two subsets (if we don't use tokenization and flattening the counter object will count characters instead of words). One subset contains all the popsong data. The other subset contains all the data - the pop song data. \n",
    "3. use the Counter object to find the words that will differ. create a vocabulary containing the counts of both dets. calculate the frequency in which the words appear. Then calculate the log-likelihood and p-value. Sort the results based on the log-likelyhood score in descending order. Evaluate the results using the log-likelihood and p-value. The words with the highest log-likelyhood scores are the most distinctive for popsongs. \n",
    "N the more often they appear to be in a popsong, the more influence they have on setting a song appart from other songs. Therefore that word will be more typical for a popsong then other words.  \n",
    "4. evaluate the new popsong by training a text classification model. Then provide the new lyrics to the model and predict wheter or not it is a popsong. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time period:\n",
    "Starting at 1990, most years afterwards are having more then 100 values in this dataset. Therefore I decided on a time period between 1990 - 2020. I assume this will help me to get a better p-value later on and therefore are more likely to obtain significant results."

    "This model shows that the song is definitly not a pop song. However, my model is imbalenced. Therefore the chance the model predicts the song to be 'notpop' is way higher than the chance that the model predicts the song to be 'pop'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the results of the model:<br>\n",
    "Precision: these are the true positives over the positive predicted values. Which means that if we take a look at 'predicted as pop' most of these are indeed part of the pop genre. We see that the prediction of 'notpop' has a precision of 0.6. This means that in 60 percent of the cases a lyrics was indeed part of the notpop category. But 40 percent of the time my model was wrong. This implies there is quite some bias in our model. Perhaps this holds a relation with the imbalance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: \n",
    "Recall shows how many of the actual positives are captured by the prediction. So how many of the 'notpop' are predicted to be 'notpop'. We can see here that there is a very low score of only 7 percent captured by the model. The pop song has a high score of 99 percent, but since a lot of 'nonpop' values are predicted as 'pop' there is a lot of bias within the categorization.\n",

    "To improve the performance of the model I would first try to balance the data by oversampling the minority class. To vectorize the words I choose the Bag Of Words model. I could try to use the spacy for tokenizatior or TF-IDF instead. I could also try a different model, like the BERT model, which is context aware. This would probably help to improve the classification of the song lyrics. \n",
